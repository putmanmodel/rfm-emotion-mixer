# RFM Emotion Mixer

**Patterned Understanding Through Meaning, Affect, Narrative**

This is a visual prototype built using the PUTMAN Model™ and Resonant Field Mapping™ to explore emotional blending and symbolic logic. Developed by Stephen A. Putman.

## 🌀 What It Does

This demo lets users explore how pairs of basic emotions interact by displaying a combined emoji and a symbolic label. It's a simple tool meant to showcase how emotion vectors can be modeled, visualized, and eventually embedded into larger AI systems.

### 🆕 Why This is Different

Unlike traditional emotion wheels or static charts, this tool models **symbolic tone blending** as a vector-based system. It’s not just labeling feelings — it’s simulating how affective resonance shifts across a field of meaning. It offers a **semantic bridge between emotion and logic**, paving the way for future AI systems to interpret emotion *with nuance and context*.

## 🌟 Example

**Emotion A:** joy + **Emotion B:** sadness → **Result:** Letdown (😞)

## 🛠️ Features

* Selectable emotion pairs
* Mixed emotion output (emoji + symbolic label)
* Companion HUD panel shows full vector transition
